Mini-Biography:
==============
Classes can sometimes feel so impersonal!  We created this mini-bio so we may get to know each other a little better. 
This will be kept confidential amongst the staff, but you don't have to fill in anything you don't wish to.

** The staff will answer them too, so how about you? **


--> Where did you grow up? What was your academic path?
(e.g. Did you live in the same town all your life or did you move around; and if so, where? Did you go to community college or another school before this one?)





--> How much programming have you done (and what languages)?





--> What are your hobbies?





--> What are some of your talents and skills?





--> Have you done anything remarkable? Has anything really memorable happened to you?
(e.g. travel, meeting famous people, 15 min of fame, inventions, overcoming adversity, etc.)





--> What commitments will be consuming your cycles this term?
(e.g. classes, jobs, family, commutes, volunteering, sports, student groups, etc.)
